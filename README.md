# A backend tutorial

This is a simple example of a backend API server, written in Javascript and
using the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework. It's intended to
illustrate key backend concepts as a example for learning.

It is part of a talk I ([Jeff Terrell](http://terrell.web.unc.edu/)) gave as
part of the [2019 UNC Makeathon](https://www.makeathon.unc.edu/). You can
